# Nobody Name Generator
## — An Angular Personal Project by Harry Yazawa —

In the games from the Kingdom Hearts franchise, by Square-Enix, a Nobody is the body and soul of a strong-willed individual who has lost their heart. Although they usually look exactly the same as the original individual, albeit with possible minor physical differences, they are given new names which consist of an amalgam of their original names with an X added to it.

This project aims to create a webpage made in Angular where the user will input a name and the page will generate a list of possible Nobody Names using the name rules established by the Kingdom Hearts franchise. This can be a great tool for those who want to create OCs (Original Characters) based on the franchise but are struggling to come up with names for their OC's Nobody.
